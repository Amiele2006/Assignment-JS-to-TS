# Composition, Aggregation and Abstraction.

## Abstraction

### Abstract Classes:
This is a blueprint that can not be directly instantiated, it is meant to be extended, it can include concrete method(with full implementation). It allows for encapsulation, reusability & polymorphism. 

## Aggregation: 
this refers to a special form of association where one class reference to annother class but both can exist independently.
